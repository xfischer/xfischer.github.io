First of all, thanks for reading this.

This is my first blog post of the universe and I'm really happy to do it.

It's late, but not too late.

I grew up as a Developer / Musician / Citizen / ... and have learned so much!

This is the time now to share. Not only show, but really share. I hope I can do it as I have imagined it would be.

# Why this blog

I have seen many interesting articles about technical things. Many of them are very useful, but many of them make you feel a little dumb at the beginning, until you fully understand.

I want to change the tone. **Every** time I start something new that I don't know and I want to learn I need help. I find dozens of articles that make me feel uncomfortable: they go straight to the point and don't tell the process of learning.

That's what I want to do. Tell the story behind the happiness of a technical result. Technicity does not help, unless you're close and just need a copy-n-paste thing to unstuck you.

# Why in English

I'm French, speak fluently Spanish and English.
But English is more universal and I more people can reach my content if it is written in English.

# The themes I want to share

- C# and .Net
- GIS stuff and 3D
- Music with Ableton Live
- Music theory
- Live shows (theatre, creating coding)

# The forthcoming articles

- .Net Core: Logging and Dependency Injection and why it's awesome
- DEM-net: the story of this project, from Tour de France to 3D
- How I made this blog
- Ableton Live and DMX: How I control lighting rig for theatre, the artisanal way

So stay tuned, and don't hesitate to get back to me through comments, Twitter, LinkedIn or mail.

Cheers!

Xavier Fischer
