I'm a French Developer from Aix-en-Provence, France. My predilection domain in .Net, and C#. I was certified as a Microsoft Certified Professional Developer.

I have worked since 2000 in the development area, in GIS, SQL Server Development.

I am devoted to share what I've learned and moreover **the way to the solution more than the solution itself**. We have all been beginners at some point, to any matter, and the path to knowledge is worth sharing! 

More recently I have been involved in open source development. I am the co-owner of [GeoJSON.Net](https://github.com/geojson-net) repository and am involved in few projects :
- [KhronosGroup glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) via my [DEM.Net](https://github.com/dem-net) project
- [SqlServerSpatial.Toolkit](https://github.com/xfischer/SqlServerSpatial.Toolkit): a great tool for Visual Studio enabling tracing and geometry visualization
- [Shape2SqlServer](https://github.com/xfischer/Shape2SqlServer): a fast and reliable ShapeFile import tool for SQL Server
